# Fruitbox Deployment Guide

## Vercel Deployment (Frontend Only) - FIXED

This project is now properly configured to deploy the frontend as a static site on Vercel.

### The Problem & Solution:

**Issue**: Vercel was trying to run `npm run build` which builds both frontend AND server code, but server files were excluded by `.vercelignore`, causing the build to fail with:
```
âœ˜ [ERROR] The entry point "server/index.ts" cannot be marked as external
```

**Solution**: Created isolated `static/` directory with pre-built files and aggressive `.vercelignore` that excludes ALL project files except `static/` and `vercel.json`. This forces Vercel to treat the deployment as pure static files.

### Current Configuration:

**vercel.json**:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "static/**/*",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/static/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**.vercelignore**:
```
*
!static/
!vercel.json
```

This configuration ensures Vercel only sees the `static/` directory and treats the deployment as pure static files.

### Quick Deploy Steps:

1. **Commit Changes** - Push the updated `vercel.json` and other configuration files
2. **Connect to Vercel** - Import your GitHub repository at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)  
3. **Auto-Deploy** - Vercel will use the configuration automatically
4. **Verify** - Your Fruitbox landing page should display correctly

### Build Details:

- **Build Strategy**: Pre-built static files (no build needed on Vercel)
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Bundle Size**: ~500KB JavaScript, ~82KB CSS
- **Deploy Time**: ~5 seconds (no build process)

### What Gets Deployed:

âœ… Complete Fruitbox landing page
âœ… Professional gradient design  
âœ… Gift icon branding (consistent with app)
âœ… Working "Book Demo" button â†’ Google Form
âœ… Responsive design for all devices
âœ… SEO optimization with meta tags
âœ… Proper SPA routing for React

### Configuration Files:

- `vercel.json` - Main deployment configuration (UPDATED)
- `.vercelignore` - Excludes server code from deployment
- `build-frontend.sh` - Backup build script
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - This guide

### Troubleshooting:

âœ… **Fixed**: Build failure with server/index.ts error
âœ… **Fixed**: Raw JavaScript code showing instead of website  
âœ… **Fixed**: Incorrect build command detection
âœ… **Fixed**: Vercel ignoring custom build configuration

**Final Solution**: Created static files directly at root level (`index.html` + `assets/` folder) and used simple Vercel rewrites. This completely avoids any npm or build detection.

If issues persist:
1. Ensure `index.html` and `assets/` folder are committed to repository
2. Clear Vercel build cache and redeploy
3. Check that all Node.js related files are excluded in `.vercelignore`

### File Structure for Deployment:
```
/ (root)
â”œâ”€â”€ static/                 # Only directory Vercel sees
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main Fruitbox landing page
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index-BBI_h-tb.css   # Styles (82KB)
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index-CzDjjPfL.js     # React app (500KB)
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.json             # Deployment configuration
â””â”€â”€ .vercelignore           # Excludes everything except static/
```

### Local Testing:

```bash
npx vite build
npx serve dist/public
```

Your Fruitbox site is now ready for successful Vercel deployment! ðŸŽ‰
