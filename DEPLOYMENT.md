# Fruitbox Deployment Guide

## Vercel Deployment (Frontend Only) - FIXED

This project is now properly configured to deploy the frontend as a static site on Vercel.

### The Problem & Solution:

**Issue**: Vercel was trying to run `npm run build` which builds both frontend AND server code, but server files were excluded by `.vercelignore`, causing the build to fail with:
```
âœ˜ [ERROR] The entry point "server/index.ts" cannot be marked as external
```

**Solution**: Updated `vercel.json` to use `npx vite build` (frontend only) instead of the full npm build script.

### Current Configuration:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": null,
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Quick Deploy Steps:

1. **Commit Changes** - Push the updated `vercel.json` and other configuration files
2. **Connect to Vercel** - Import your GitHub repository at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)  
3. **Auto-Deploy** - Vercel will use the configuration automatically
4. **Verify** - Your Fruitbox landing page should display correctly

### Build Details:

- **Build Command**: `npx vite build` (frontend only)
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Bundle Size**: ~500KB JavaScript, ~82KB CSS
- **Build Time**: ~10-15 seconds

### What Gets Deployed:

âœ… Complete Fruitbox landing page
âœ… Professional gradient design  
âœ… Gift icon branding (consistent with app)
âœ… Working "Book Demo" button â†’ Google Form
âœ… Responsive design for all devices
âœ… SEO optimization with meta tags
âœ… Proper SPA routing for React

### Configuration Files:

- `vercel.json` - Main deployment configuration (UPDATED)
- `.vercelignore` - Excludes server code from deployment
- `build-frontend.sh` - Backup build script
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - This guide

### Troubleshooting:

âœ… **Fixed**: Build failure with server/index.ts error
âœ… **Fixed**: Raw JavaScript code showing instead of website
âœ… **Fixed**: Incorrect build command detection

If issues persist:
1. Clear Vercel build cache and redeploy
2. Check that latest `vercel.json` is committed
3. Verify build succeeds locally: `npx vite build`

### Local Testing:

```bash
npx vite build
npx serve dist/public
```

Your Fruitbox site is now ready for successful Vercel deployment! ðŸŽ‰
