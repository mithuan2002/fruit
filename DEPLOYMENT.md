# Fruitbox Deployment Guide

## Vercel Full-Stack Deployment

This project is configured for full-stack deployment on Vercel with both frontend and backend functionality.

### Current Configuration:

**vercel.json**:
- Deploys the Node.js backend as a serverless function
- Serves the React frontend through the same server
- Handles both API routes and static file serving

**.vercelignore**:
- Excludes development files and dependencies
- Includes all necessary source files for build

### Prerequisites:

1. **Neon Database**: Your PostgreSQL database connection string
2. **Interakt API**: Your WhatsApp integration credentials (optional for basic functionality)

### Deploy Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your code is committed to a GitHub repository

2. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the configuration

3. **Set Environment Variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_connection_string
   SESSION_SECRET=your_random_session_secret
   INTERAKT_API_TOKEN=your_interakt_token (optional)
   INTERAKT_BUSINESS_NUMBER=your_whatsapp_number (optional)
   ```

4. **Deploy**: Vercel will build and deploy automatically

### What Gets Deployed:

âœ… Complete referral marketing system
âœ… Authentication and user management
âœ… Product management with point calculation
âœ… Campaign management with flexible rules
âœ… Sales processing with real-time calculations
âœ… Customer management and WhatsApp integration
âœ… Dashboard with analytics and reporting
âœ… POS integration capabilities
âœ… Professional UI with dark/light theme support

### Key Features:

- **Point System**: Flexible point calculation (fixed, percentage, tier-based)
- **Campaign Management**: Create and manage referral campaigns
- **Sales Processing**: Process transactions with automatic point calculation
- **Customer Management**: Add customers and track their activity
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Automated customer notifications
- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics and performance tracking
- **POS Integration**: Support for Square, Shopify, and custom APIs

### Build Process:

- **Frontend**: Vite builds the React application
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Serverless**: Optimized for Vercel's serverless functions

### Troubleshooting:

If deployment fails:
1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Ensure DATABASE_URL points to a valid PostgreSQL database
3. Verify the database schema is up to date (run migrations if needed)
4. Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages

### Local Testing:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Push database schema
npm run db:push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Post-Deployment:

1. Test the authentication system
2. Create your first products and campaigns
3. Process a test sale to verify point calculation
4. Configure WhatsApp integration if desired
5. Set up POS integration for automatic customer sync

Your Fruitbox system is now ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
